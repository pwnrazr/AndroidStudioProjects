# Root Test
Second app. What it does is it "requests" for root permission and then it remounts / as RW, create a file in /system, deletes it then remounts / as RO
This will be the foundation of my next app which needs to echo to /sys/module/smb5_lib/parameters/skip_therm for iMMENSITY Kernel's skip thermal mitigation
